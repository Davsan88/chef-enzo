# 🍳 Chef Enzo Recipe App

## **Hey there! 👋**

Welcome to the **Chef Enzo Recipe App!** This project was built following a tutorial on Scrimba. The app lets you input a list of ingredients you have at home, and it uses AI to suggest some tasty recipes you can whip up. It's a fun way to get creative in the kitchen without wasting any ingredients!
